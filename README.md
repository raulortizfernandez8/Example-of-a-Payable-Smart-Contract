# ðŸ’¸ PayableContract
This Solidity smart contract demonstrates how to securely receive and withdraw Ether (ETH) using payable functions.

ðŸ§¾ Description
PayableContract is a simple contract that allows you to:

Receive Ether using the sendEther() function.

Withdraw Ether using the WithdrawEther() function.

This pattern is essential for contracts that handle Ether transactions, as receiving funds without a way to withdraw them can represent a critical vulnerability.
